This project refers to my Master's Thesis, available at http://repositorio.ufjf.br:8080/jspui/handle/ufjf/14055.

The goal here was to study the competitive dynamics of public high-quality higher education institutions in Brazil for the year of 2018.
For that, I have used Python and Pandas to clean and treat initial data from the Higher Education Census (INEP) for the year of 2018, in order to
asses market structure under the light of the Industrial Organization field. Also, further data from Web of Science and INPI were combined with
data from the census to assess performance, modeled through a Data Envelopment Analysis model in R.
